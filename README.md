# Project Background: 📝

Our project basically derived from the snake.io game, which is an easy web game. The main goal of the original game is to collect the most points and not crash into the border of the web, or else the game will be over. Our team used this original code and added more functions and spicers to its boring design, for instance, the background and icons changed from normal geometrical shape into turtles by using turtle library form Python. The aim is to create a grid line, so users can get the idea of where the perimeter of the game is. Moving on to the coding part, we added lines that take care of the direction that the turtle’s head will face after making turns. With extra spices on the counted score and displays of background, to give a more realistic vibe. On top of that, after the game ends, we add more code to display “Game over” to let the user know that they’ve lost.

## Timeline ⏳

* 30-May 
	* Still in the progress of figuring out what to do.

* 1-June 
	* we can create a better avatar and graphical interface / draw some png instead of the red dots and black squares for the snake / make it look a bit better we can create more variations for points / or add in further challenges like add a bomb that will decrease the points if the snake touches it we can create a game over screen and a start screen as well to make it a bit clearer we can add an option for personal best
            
* June 3
	*  Did our code, changed the background. Changed the game into Turtle catch Turtle. Did most of the coding corrections here. Figure out how to turn turtle’s head and add “Game over”
           
* June 6th
	* Puye - Make a cover page for the game. Lily - Art work for background and new characters in the game. Beam - Connect to Github. Mostly figure out how to share the code.
	
* June 9th
	* Project Presentation Main File: Snake.py Background Image: Untitled_artwork.png
