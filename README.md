# python

Still in the progress of figuring out what to do.

30-May Update 1-June we can create a better avatar and graphical interface 
/ draw some png instead of the red dots and black squares for the snake 
/ make it look a bit better we can create more variations for points 
/ or add in further challenges like add a bomb that will decrease the points if the snake touches it we can create a game over screen and a start screen as well to make it a bit clearer we can add an option for personal best

Checked: Did our code, changed the background. Changed the game into Turtle catch Turtle.
